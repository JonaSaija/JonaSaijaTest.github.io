                <h4>Unity:</h4>
                <div class="project-image"></div>
                Definition: Unity is a game development engine that allows developers to create 2D, 3D, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) games and applications.
                Features: Unity provides a user-friendly interface, a vast asset store, and supports a wide range of platforms, including PC, consoles, mobile devices, and more.
                Workflow: Unity uses a component-based system where game objects are constructed by attaching components to them. Developers can design scenes visually and use C# scripts to add functionality.

            <p>
                <h4>C#:</h4>
                <div class="project-image"></div>
                Definition: C# (pronounced C-sharp) is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.
                Usage in Unity: C# is the primary language for scripting in Unity. Game logic, interactions, and behaviors are often written in C# scripts that interact with Unity's API (Application Programming Interface).
                Syntax: C# syntax is similar to other C-based languages like C++ and Java. It is known for its simplicity, type safety, and garbage collection.

                <h4>Unity and C# Integration:</h4>
                <div class="project-image"></div>
                Scripting: In Unity, developers use C# to write scripts that control the behavior of game objects, handle user input, manage animations, and more.
                Events: Unity's event-driven architecture allows developers to respond to various events, such as collisions, user input, and animations, using C# methods.
                API Access: C# scripts in Unity have access to the Unity API, which provides a wide range of functions and classes for interacting with the game engine.

                <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                <div class="project-image"></div>
                Community Support: Unity has a large and active community, and C# is widely used, making it easier to find resources, tutorials, and assistance.
                Versatility: Unity with C# is suitable for both beginners and experienced developers, offering flexibility for various game genres and applications.
                Cross-Platform Development: Unity allows developers to build games for multiple platforms using a single codebase, and C# facilitates this cross-platform compatibility.
